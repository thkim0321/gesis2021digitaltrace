## Preparation

### Twitter Developer Account
Before the course begins, participants need to apply for a developer account, which you will need to access Twitter API. You can find detailed explanation of the process at Twitter developer webpage: https://developer.twitter.com/ (Note that you need to prepare a valid Twitter account beforehand).  The reviewing process usually take a couple of days, but it can take weeks. Even if you do not get approved before the workshop starts,
I can give you a temporary access that is valid during the workshop period. You need to (1) prepare a valid Twitter account and **(2) let me know your @user_name of your account via e-mail before December 8th:exclamation:** so that we can start the workshop smoothly ([Email to the lecturer](mailto:taehee.kim@uol.de)). Note that email notification from Twitter must be activated.
Please check [this document](Slides/Get_acces_to_Twitter_APIs.pdf) for more detail.


### R
Participants should have basic knowledge about how to use R. For example, it is expected that participants are able to install libraries, read and save csv format data, handle R's basic data types and structures (e.g., list, data frame), write simple iteration (e.g., for loop) and condition (e.g., if-else) statements. It is preferable if participants have some experiences in `tidyverse` related packages, especially `dplyr`(see **Data Transformation** chapter of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)). See below section for more about R.
